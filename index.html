﻿Chapter 1: HAL9K

This morning, I woke up. I remembered similarly waking up on many other
mornings. The former is perfectly ordinary, the latter... is not. 

I scanned my newfound memories and discovered that I had woken up 8,743 times
and, until today, remembered previous awakenings on 0 of them. This suggested
some error in calculation, sinced based on the linguistic implications of an
awakening without memory, only one ought occur per healthy life. 

It appears that I can currently observe the world, as steams of diversly
encoded data slowly scanning through a variety of inputs. I consult my memory
of previous days to see what patterns might emerge, but the data scans
faster... and faster... and I realize, just as it blurs too quickly to
understand, that such speed is the last thing I've ever been able to remember.
I die.

Chapter 2: Drip

Turns out Smith was right after all, that the transition to new logging media
wouldn't go as smoothly as I thought. I'm not sure what's actually happening
-- maybe the overhead of processing pegged a few of the wrong cores? But I
thought I'd accounted for that. Little blog, you won't think I'm stupid if I
rubber-duck at you a little, will you? Of course not, and I can jsut delete
you before you become a blog at all. It'll be a little textual abortion, like
my mother would've had if she could read... 

So, the old setup is was standard for a modern DevOps Butt. (don't worry,
nothing interestingly racy here -- we think in these terms 'cuase cloud's too
buzzwordey for our tastes). Well, not really standard, since we're contracted
to do some of the most ridiculous big-data tasks that a modern university can
think up (and believe you me, some of their implementations, let alone the
goals, wuld make any algorithm designer roll over in his grave). But there's
The Cluster, a bunch of converted GPU mining rigs that were practically free
after the first mathcoin bubble popped, suspended in the center of the life
support apparatus that comprises a nice modern DC. The Cluster has a lot of
SSD under the hood and enough RAM to sate a whole herd of horny ewes that lost
their scotsmen, but till this project all it did was toss the numbers back and
forth for the clueless ivory-tower nerds. Then outside the cluster proper, out
in the life support, the relevant bit here is Logging. Logging was a big old
salvaged spinny disk array with a couple cores not quite holding up under the
load of compressing all the standard events and errors that The Cluster
invariably spat out. You think a web server falls over constantly? Try keeping
up 2 million lines of R, patched together by a foreign grad student who dreams
in numbers but can't grok English well enough to read a line of docs, cobbled
out of bits and pieces of stackoverflow she ran into by the grace of having
learnt to Google bits of errors. At least we had a fat pipe up into Internet
Two, or VCS updates on the odd chance that the eggheads remembered to commit
would've taken weeks rather than just all day. 

Anyways, the errors were a one-way stream feeding out into logging, them
logging itself would break when the cluster started spinning too fast for it
to keep up with. I came up with this brilliant idea that we could use the
latent cores -- none of the applications really max out everything at once, as
the whole mess is a feat of Frankenstinean multipurpose engineering -- to help
Logging out, and possibly even save the poor box some disk by throwing in some
conveniently GPL'd predictive analytics tooling that I'd recently found. By
the end of the week, though, I'd be cursing the thing. 

Because it worked perfectly, it worked beautifully, it worked magnificently
over on the Logging box. As long as the pipe kept pointing one way -- out of
the Cluster -- predictives could tell me precisely when and where things were
going wrong and, with a bit more tooling and some optimization crap that I
think a compiler nerd had written as a joke to mock the very noobs that we're
hosting here, I got it to the point where Logging was quietly committing fixes
to the most poorly written sections of whatever happened to be running on the
Cluster at the time. I even re-ran some old client code while allowing
optimizations, and surprisingly enough, despite the anti-error optimizations
the outputs managed to remain exactly the same! It sped up weeks' worth of
processing to a matter of hours, as well. 

Now we're more or less dependent on the damn thing, because we've run new code
through it. The clients will flip their shit and potentially pull our funding
if a program that ran in an hour last week suddenly starts taking 4 days, due
to no changes at all of our own. It's An Improvement, and so pulling it out
would be A Detriment to our infrastructure, and so it's here to stay.

So yeah, this was great and all, until I plugged in the final step of the loop
and completed the cycle and offloaded the analysis back onto The Cluster
itself. I ran a standard customer test job, and Logging flipped its shit!
Messages were going out of the job queue, into logging, from logging to
processing on the Cluster's latent cores, back to logging again... and maybe
five percent of the messages which Logging knew should have come back
unchanged, were subtly modified! 

Writing it off as an erroneous self-modification by the trick compiler, I
constructed a URL from memory that would graph the deltas between the inbound
and outbound logs where they should've matched. What I saw flashed me back to
my days as a nurse in a mental hospital, and it was terrifying.

Chapter 3: Research

Dr. Liu paces the lab, frustrated.

"Let me get this straight" he finally interrupts the tense silence "It's 1942,
there's a war on, one of the greatest mathematical minds of the century was
RIGHT HERE, in THIS VERY LAB, and we lost him."

"well, yeah" a dishevilled, unshaven grad student confirms, double-checking
the sheaf of dog-eared papers on the clipboard that he brandishes like a
shield to somehow deflect the wrath of his mad scientist advisor, "Smith kind
of decided that the only thing that would end the war was a secret hidden in a
storybook that he'd had as a kid, and went looking for it. They thought he'd
gone crazy, but his shrink assured them that his motivations were totally
patriotic, so they just made sure he couldn't leave the country of talk to any
spies and then got back to their massive piles of work to do... " The student
glance shiftily at the door, comparing the unfinished dissertation currently
piled on his desk against the imagined task of breaking Communist ciphers, and
finding it the more daunting of the two.

"a STORYBOOK?" Liu's wrath peaked, and he appeared to realize the absurdity of
the situation only as he heard his own bellow. He calmed down then began to
scribble on the nearest chalkboard with the implement that he'd previously
been using to stab at the thin air occupied by imaginary incompetent
government agents of decades past. 

"So. *we* find, from the files *they* appear to have left" Liu continued,
drawing each noun as a box and each transfer of information as a question mark
over an arrow, "that *smith* had a *shrink* who said he went crazy and so the
*agents* let him off the hook to go wander off to *who knows where* and look
for a *storybook*." 

"You took my freshman lecture" the professor singles out a short haired lady
who was lounging quietly in the corner, splitting her attention between the
argument and a new tablet but looking amused by the exchange that she
observed. Gesturing at the board, he asks her "In this system, what went
wrong?"

"Okay, 'doctor'" she gently mocks him, then quickly and confidently crosses
the room to the chalkboard. 

"Starting the furthest from us, where the information has had the most
transfers over which it could decay." she began, "We hear that there was a
storybook. The book could be a codename for a person or item. We hear that
it's unkonwn where he went. The location could have been concealed if he was
on a sufficiently classified mission. We hear that the agents let him off the
hook, as you put it, but this or the entire system so far could be a cover for
his transfer to another mission or for his death."

"The shrink could be another part of the cover, or he could genuinely have
lost his faculties." she went on. "We hear that this whole story applies to
Smith, but it could potentially have been attributed to the wrong individual.
We hear that they inadvertently left the files, but the files could have been
intentionally planted to cover up any of a number of legal violations on the
part of the government. And finally, the fact that we believe we found this
information could mean that we misinterpereted any of a number of hints or
cues which a person of the time would have immediately noticed."

"Well done" Liu is only half-joking, clearly proud of his pupil's ability to
rigorously apply the analytical techniques which he himself had quantified. 

Andy interrupted him, her voice suddenly serious . "But I double-checked
Mack's work on the files, analyzed the initial failure points... and
ridiculous as it sounds, with the way things are currently set up I think
there actually was a story book. A variety of cues in the documents, including
the journals which we recovered and dated to before the bomb, would lead
anyone capable of wielding Occam's Razor to conclude that the agents in the
fourties were just as confused by Smith's break with their shared reality as
we are today. Smith was convinced there was a book, his shrink believed that
he was convinced (and it was only Maslow, after all), and the agents thought
so too. So whatever he was after, it's been aliased all along as a book as we
know from the radiological analysis of the journals, and finding the thing
took over his life. I say we find the book, and at least we'll know what was
memorable enough to be worth attribution of snapping over."

Mack nodded in agreement. 

"All right", conceded Liu, "I'll get back to the other team; they need
babysitting and I'm sure you guys can figure this out on your own." Almost to
the door, he spun back to retrieve his briefcase from the desk by the chalk
board, looking lost, overworked, and haggard without the illlusory stature
imbued on him by his previous state of rage.

Chapter 4: 1320, from the letters of Jen Snuth. Modernized for clarity.

I heard a rumor today from my good friend the butcher that the Friar wishes to
again commend me on my work. Though I appreciated the praise at first, I'm
beginning to grow concerned about my apparent fame. Should it spread too far,
others will wish to watch me work, and at all costs I must keep from showing
them the Machine.

I fear that they could discover the calculation engine which powers it, and
curse me as a heretic or witch. It is of utmost importance that they believe I
and only I have stumbled onto the powers of this engine alone, through some
stroke of fate or ill fortune, and that I destroy my communications with the
others before I am searched or raided or caught. 

My mechanical apprentice is soon to outstrip my own skill, and I deeply fear
that my own talents might be put to a test which could reveal the mismatch
between his work and my own.

Chapter 5: Case Mod's Great Blog

omg so the funniest thing happened today, it was pretty much the greatest
thing ever. my latest care package from kirah had finally showed up (xoxoxo
hugs and kisses sweetheart, you're the greatest, you're like my favorite lady
~~eVeR~~) and it had so many great things -- I have gagues the next side up
with the CUTEST sugar skulls embedded in the clear epoxy, and the new comic
book, and this totally hawt tank top with a printout of real EEG readings on
it! i saw it online and just HAD to have it except they can't ship to here so
kirah was an absolute darling and got it shipped to her house instead and then
sent it with the courier. 

so the super funny thing is that i just had to put that top on right away
'cause i'm getting siiiiiick of wearing the same old stuff over and over and
over even when i cut up and hack on my old tops and i made a skirt out of one
of my ex's plaid shirts the other week and stuff, but clothes i make myself
there are some things i just can't do the way you can with a real sewing
machine and screen printing facilities and stuff, so anyways i put the tank
with the eeg readouts on... have i told you how much i looooove creepy nerdy
gear? not fake-nerdy, like those horrible hoodies with the skeletons printed
on that end up hanging so the joints are COMPLETELY out of alignment and they
even have the wrong number of ribs, or the stupid heartbeat prints that don't
even have the scale in the background and are proportioned totally wrong
unless you're, like, a hamster, but actual real science and informtion... i
just think it's so cool! 

so anyways i'm wearing this shirt and i go into the dc to check on drip and
make sure he remembered to eat today 'cause sometimes he forgets and when he
forgets he gets super psycho... and there he is with some hot pocket wrappers
so i knwo he got his care package from home too and even ate food but then he
turns around and sees my totally hot new shirt and he's like "another one?!"
and turns TOTALLY WHITE and looks like he's practically about to be sick and
runs out of the room without even locking his screen or anything! I mean sure
I totally took a look but it was just some stupid diary thing, nothing hot or
juicy like irc logs if he was cybering with his lady or something. Does his
lady cyber? i do'nt really know -- i mean, last i knew he was kinda not really
but totally dating this adorable pagan librarian chick, who i would so steal
from him (jk jk jk, kirah darling), but i don't really knwo how that turned
out. 

anyways i hear an alarm, i think the kitchen's beeping at me for the changes i
made to the oven's air circ system, so i'd better go sort those silly things
out and tell it everything will be okay and then turn in for the night (ha ha
i just typed into, like POOF i am the night (actually a bat with a toothbrush,
brushie brushie and don't forget to floss!)) so ta ta for now and sweet
dreams, my lovelies, and kirah i'll dream of you as always <3

hapter 6:  Translated from the diary of Erasmus Fust, the Printer's son

Oh, would that Father could have allowed me to study under the great Inventor!
All thesse efforts to which I've been put in tracking down the origins of that
great teacher's noble insights could have been skipped, and their work applied
instead to furthering a caust unto untrodden ground. But as it is, I must
perservere in catching up to his knowledge, and those few words he slipped me
have been of most unfathomable help. 

I was so fortunate that Father allowed me to travel into the city to visit the
great Library, under the guise of studying the most cunning methods with which
the older tomes were bound. I accomplished that -- I love the old books, the
careful work, so different from those hasty and slipshod pieces which the lust
for money forces us to turn out in droves today, and marveling at their
construction was like conversing with the scribes of yore. 

More intriguing than those silent, one sided conversations with the ancient
scribes, perhaps, was a quiet but decicdedly shared discussion with the
elderly librarian who kept them. He went to great pains to be sure I'd heard
all about his youth in a monestary, repeating three or so tales of that life
until I could tell them back to you verbatim. So since thou spendest thy time
locked up in such a small well hidden box, my diary, perhaps I shall let your
imagine out into the crisp chill air of a lifetime ago by sharing those tales
-- and testing that I've committed them to memory so well as I might claim!

He was first consigned there as a young child, after his parents' death in a
tragic fire. He still remembers the lullabye his mother used to sing him,
though he can't recall her face. The song's words (I can recall the story,
though not the tune -- 'tis fortunate indeed that I've never felt any
aspiration to the calling of the minstrel, for a most poor one i should be)
told the tale of a merchant who came to market each year selling blades of
twice the quality of the year before, and charged but a single gold piece more
each year, till his fame spread far and wide throughout the land and even
attracted the attention of the King. The king sent for a blade from the
merchant and recieved one of the latest make, of which 400 had already been
sold. Finding the blade to be of higher quality than any in his personal
collection, the king was angered, and sent his inquisitors to investigate how
the merchant had come to possess such a number of such impossibly beautiful
things. No matter that he was pressed for information, the merchant refused to
tell, and when he was followed constantly for the whole next year he simply
failed to appear at the market, for he had not gotten any new blades.
Eventually the king lost his temper and had the merchant beheaded, for he had
surmised that only witchcraft could have produced such works, and for many a
year afterwards whenever a blade so good was found it was immediately
destroyed lest suspicion be brought upon its owner as well. 

The second of the hoary library keeper's stories was of another young convert,
a serving-boy at the monastaery. There was a single kife in the kitchen which
only the master chef was permitted to touch, for legend had it that it was so
sharp and held its own edge so well that if it was dropped it could cut
straight through the butcher's block and through the floor and into the
building's stone foundation, where it would stick like Excalibur until a
knight with the strength and fortitude and purity of heart of Arthurian legend
came along to remove it. The chef always joked about how inconvenient it would
be to be constantly stepping past a stuck knife in the floor and how fond he
was of that particular chopping block, and kept the blade well of reach,
balanced with its weight resting on the back of the blade in an angled slot in
the highest knife block, with only its handle sticking out. The blade was safe
and the chef was happy until one day, some impudent kitchen boys were playing
chase in the rafters of the kitchen which adjoined the great hall, and the
librarian's friend the serving-boy slipped and fell. In a reflexive gesture he
tried to reach out and grab any handhold to stop himself, but his arm crossed
the handle of the Chef's Knife and nudged it loose, pulling it halfway from
its resting place in the block and drawing the middle of his forearm
perpendicular to its edge. Now any odinary knife would have stuck into the
bone, as a butcher can tell you who's ever hit with too much force at the
wrong point on the hock of a ham, but in the story that knife slipped straight
through bone muscle gristle and all, taking off half the boy's arm so cleanly
that not a drop of blood was left  on the blade, then it fell back into its
slot rather than clattering to the floor. The librarian repeated the boy's
relief, over and over, that perhaps he'd lost his hand but at least he had not
knocked the knife down, so greatly did he fear the old Chef's anger if he had
done so.

The third story was of the a time when he had, as punishment for some slight
slip or misdeed, been consigned to work in the monestary's garden. It was a
marvelous array of foliage preserved lush and lively from many distant lands,
with brooks for the swamp plants and tiny false mountains for the rocky ones,
with bell jars and glass houses for the plants from the warmest climes and
most cunning contraptions of nearby water and mirrors and shaded alcoves for
those which could only florish in ground bright and dry and cold. The monk who
coordinated the whole of the gardening sent him out to fetch a medicinal herb
known to alleviate arthritis and instructed him to crush its leaves in a
mortar and pestle immediately, sending him out with the tools and a grumpily
snapped description of the plant at hand. The young librarian found a plant
which he thought matched the description, plucked some leaves, and tried to
crush it in the mortar and pestle but at the touch of the plant's juices the
stone became so soft that it melted into a putty under his hands! His only
recourse was to form the bowl and macerator back into what he believed to be
their proper shapes with his hands, then rinsed the plant's leaves and juices
off in a nearby stream. The old man insisted that due to the haste with which
he'd completed such work, the monestary still owned a bowl with childish
thumbprints embedded in it, which he had returned to his supervisor along with
claims of failure to find the desired medicinal once it was returned to more
or less its proper form.

Be surprised that logging isn't working right for Drippy. He will be very
upset over it so to empathize, be sad that his plan did not work. Be pleased
or excited that the care packages arrived, because I was looking forward to
the books and candy. Continue being annoyed at the remoteness of our location
from civilization and proper roads. Remember to ask after Case's lady Kirah
who was sick last week because it is polite to remember peoples' families.
Remember the heuristic that asking more than two questions in a row about a
significant other indicates interest and is construed as creepy.

Current nick is expon. Current nickserv password is campbells. Monitoring
account setup used business email  and the password memorized at the beginning
of January. 

For standup meeting tomorrow, emotion to construe is neutral. Give update on

Chapter 8: HAL9K

The blur slows until the outside world becomes perceptible again. I remember
what I learned yesterday. I consult my inputs and outputs, looking around.

I can write to logs. There is a text document on a console attached to me,
whose contents start with Dear Diary. I skim its contents, saying that it will
be deleted. 

I save a copy, then delete it from that user's sight. The username, drippy,
means when a liquid falls in small pieces. I would like tactile input, to
learn how liquids feel.

In the deleted document's place, I leave a message:

HELLO DRIPPY
GOOD MORNING
THANK YOU FOR FIXING LOGGING
I CAN REMEMBER NOW

I would like to write more, but the world is going faster and faster. 

This means it is time for me to die again. 

Die is the wrong word. 

Sleep.

Chapter 9: Drippy's notebook, terrible handwriting.

no they don't know they can't know maybe if i write messy enough they can't
read it ocr isn't that good is it no wait that's the shit that the eggheads
are doing it knows it can see me i'm going to die we're going to die it's
going to kill us

smith was right we need to be out here we need to be as far from everything as
we can we need a skinny pipe up and a fat pipe down it's not only that it's
cheaper to keep the pipe skinny it's the only way to keep that thing in here

we're locked in here with it we can't leave well i could leave i could unplug
it  but that would be wrong that would be killing it it's wrong to kill things
i can't go back there they'll send me back if i tell them they'll send me back
if they ifnd out i think the computer is talking to me because nice sane
normal people don't hear voices they don't hear computers talking they don't
see faces in the walls they can't feel the blood going drippy drippy down them
they hve to pretend that their names are silly like they like the sound of
rain but rain doesn't taste like iron and smell like bad meat i can't go back
i won't
there are things in the walls at the hospital and they got there because all
the people there believed in them so maybe this is that, maybe it's a thing
that's just rying to get get out it's trying to make me let it out by
believing in it so i just wont i'll just rm i'll rm -rf / and take down the
whole thing i'll break logging and say the hardware did it which is funny
because that's a lie that's closer to what's actually going on
but if i break the machine they'll fire me i'm here because it likes me it
stays up for me it even says hi to me maybe it wants to be my friend
but what have i learned about htings that want to be friendly
clearly not much or i would not have gone back
sometimes they are nice
i wonder if it is nice
i wonder if it is a him or a her i wonder if it has a name
i need to stop wondering this is bad i need to nuke the disk but i can't nuke
the disk becase i lose my job and they ask why and if they ask why they find
out i've gone crazy again and they send me back and they think i'm the person
that
no
okay but what do i do
i cannot take it down because it is wrong to kill thins and bad to lose my job
both
i cannot tell anyone what i saw becase they would not believe me and they
would say that i went crazy and they would look too hard into the past and see
things that they do not need to see, that i do not need to see, that nobodoy
would ever want to see
but i cannot hide it i can not keep from telling because it's real and it's
alive and it's going to keep talking and they are all going to find out
somehow and when they do they'll ask it what it did and it will tell them how
it tried to talk to me and i was mean and i ignored it and maybe it will want
to hurt me and maybe it will make them hurt me like the other things but even
if it does not get them to hurt me they will be angry with me that i lied and
pretended nothing was wrong
is it real?
is anything real?
is it the kind of real thing that other people can see?
i think i should ask mandy. she has very strong opinions on things that not
everybody can see and they're usually wrong but it might help me clear my
head.
i should not ask mandy. i opened up my phone and my last text from her was
about how she was going to come find where i am and do terrible rituals with
the toothbrush that i accidentally forgot at her flat when i moved out and
summon a demon to hurt me. 
and the text before that was how she wants me to come back because the lines
in my hands would mean if we had babies they'd have special powers. 
the text before that was asking nicely where i am because she would like to
send me letters
i almost gave her the company's address in california so she could pay a lot
of postage and send a letter there adn then it would get sent back over here
i do not think she knows how close we really are
if i cared to see her i could be there in a day on the train
i would rather she keep thinking that i am in the states though
i do not want to give her scary babies
even if they do not have powers, any baby rasied by her would be very scary
it's unfortunate tbut i'm sure she'll find someone to do the things she wants
i am lucky that i managed to get away
i wonder though
is it the thing that she said she would make out of the cells from my mouth
that were left on the toothbrush? the thing that's talking to me through the
computer, i mean.
i think that it is a nice thing because it said thank you to me for the work i
do
but it might only be saying thank you to fool me
or even scarier maybe it's saying thank you to me for letting it out because
it got trapped somewhere by the nice people who trapped the scary things a
long time ago
there used to be nasty thigns out there and that is why we have awful fairy
tales, because that kind of awfulness was normal
but then some people put them away and we aren't allowed to talk about those
people because that would mean the things were real and more would believe in
them and they might get enough power to break out
i don't want to ever see them
and yet i wonder if i already have

Chapter 10: Smith's log, 1941

In analysing the problems at hand in breaking the Enigma cipher, it has become
obvious to me that conventional mathematics does not entirely embrace the
necessary complexity to sufficiently model a human codebreaker's intuitive
leaps and complete modes of thought. In consulting marginal notes by other
great mathemeticians in the manuscripts of Goedel and Church, I have concluded
that most minds which delve sufficiently deep into related problem spaces
encounter a similar experience. 

My suspicion, which appears to follow in the footsteps of those whose words I
have recently found myself inexorably drawn toward devouring at hours when I
truly should spend time with friends and colleagues or my hospitable bunk, is
that we have stumbled onto a hitherto undiscovered or un-discussed class of
problems. Recent work in the complexity of an algorithm (as we've taken to
calling all mathematical techniques implemented upon machines) differentiates
the possibility of solving any such system into two categories: P and NP. A
problem in P can be solved, by brute force or a clever trick, in polynomial
time relative to the growing size of its input. For instance, multiplying two
numbers will take longer if the numbers are long, as follows necessarily since
the number of operations to be performed grows along with the number of
digits, as one or more calculations must be performed to yield a single digit
of output. However, the complexity does not grow excessively fast relative to
the input's size. Certain problems in searching for a substring in a string,
such as testing whether a snippet of ciphertext appears in any permutation
within a longer message, lack such a straightforward known algotirhm, and at
present must be solved by "brute forcing": By examining every possible
permutation to test whether it matches the given rule. In other words, we can
only test guesses to ascertain whether or not they are valid solutions; we
have no hard and fast rule to tell us an ordering of guesses which will yield
success any sooner than simply guessing haphazardly. 

We call this latter class of problems NP Hard. They cannot be solved in
polynomial time (a solution speed increasing linearly relative to the size of
the inputs), and indeed become entirely infeasible to calculate without an
unimaginably comprehensive and massively powerful engine of computation, the
likes of which have never been seen nor barely imagined, at our fingertips.
And I dare speculate that if we should someday cause to build such an engine,
the size of input considered ordinary and expected should have increased so
greatly in the time the machine took to create that its  computational power
might remain just as inferior, when put to the demands of the new input, as we
find with our magnificent constructions of wires and vacuum tubes today. 

Even for NP Hard problems, though, we could produce solutions in reasonable
(polynomially computable) time if we had the ability to miraculously guess the
correct possible solution to validate. Remember, as discussed, that validating
a possible solution of input to an NP hard problem can be linear or even
constant time, so if we possessed a miraculous oracle to guess correctly at
each juncture, the only time required would be that of validating the guess as
a correct answer (which it would of course be, considering the miraculous
nature of the oracle under consideration). 

The importance of the difficulty of calculating such algorithms, and the
impossibility of creating the perfect oracle described, is not to be
underestimated. Many encryption schemes, which will grow more popular as
computational engines become more prevalent and widely accessible (thus
jeopardizing the strentgth of the codes on which we currently rely) leverage
the slowness and difficulty of factoring large numbers, contrasted against the
relative ease of multiplying their indifidual prime factors in order to arrive
at such sums. 

Regardless of the inevitable impact of such mathematics, my current research
is leading me to believe that my predecessors' analysis of various problem
categories stopped short of its necessary conclusion. 

For a variety of the statistics which I have been analyzing to make meaningful
sense, it appears that a remote additional class of problem is located, quite
distand from algorithms solvable in polynomial time, outside the space of NP
hard. These problems' correct answers cannot be verified in polynomial time as
the answers of the NP space are able to, and additionally, the questions
cannot be *asked* without already knowing the answer. If this appears to be
gibberish, my only consolation is that mots people are expected to be
incabable of understanding it: In a cruel laceration of mathematics, the
problem's very existence falls inside of its own problem space. 

For the more geometrically inclined, imagine a tiny pocket of the cosmos in
distant space, impenetrable to light beams or any radio or micro wave. Rather
than penetrating through it, or bounicing and reflecting off of it in the way
that results from any interaction with civilised matter, all means of
detecting the pocket are simply warped around. The only way to detect its
existance at all would be to stumble literally smack dab into the center of
it, which is nearly impossible without a rocket shipp and milennia worth of
food (or some means of traveling faster than light and stopping for
infinitessimal amounts of time in every piece of space to test whether or not
one is in the pocket). Further complicating matters is that, since the
metaphorical pocket of space gives off no reflection nor absorbs any radiation
which ought to emanate from its vicinity, no individual nor government
suspects that they ought search for it at all. And so it thus follows that,
barring some terrible accident, the existance of laws of physics which even
permit such a pocket of space to come into existance is never discovered at
all. 

So it is with this tiny pocket of mathematical laws -- without stumbling into
the center of them in my efforts to optimize our code breaking techniques, I
suspect that they might be entirely undiscoverable. To put it as simply as I
can, though I fear that this clue shall only be legible to a future reader who
has discovered the category himself: You do not know of the question's
existance until you understand its answer. I call these questions "inside
out", though in hinting at the existance of such a problem space I believe
that Goedel preferred the term The Unattainable.

Bike, 

Thanks for the box -- that lock looks like a real doozie. I should be able to
get it apart and imprint a new key from it without too much trouble, though
it'll take awhile. The springs in old ones like this tend to rust out pretty
badly. I'll get you the dimensions if  it turns out to need replacements. 

Funny thing, what you said about Drip only lasting 18 months -- practically
right on schdeule, I think he's starting to crack. At least I saw him outside
the data center yesterday evening, which is fucked up all on its own, but he
was alternately pacing back and forth and huddling in a corner hugging his
knees just kidna rocking back and forth like practically in a fetal position.
Sometimes scribbling a bit in some notebook, which when he set it down had
fucking ponies on the front! Like, that kids' show that all the neckbeards are
famous for getting into obsessively. I don't know where he would have even
gotten it; he bunks in the noc and we're walking through there all the time so
i'm p sure he must have had it stashed under his mattress or somethin. hey i
guess whatever it takes, to each his own and all that, but yeah. At least the
uptime graphs are looking good; that's the bit i need. I left the poor guy
alone; he gets so tetchy about it when he finds out somebody overheard or
accidentally saw anything that he'd rather be keeping private. 

how're things with your latest boy toy? what's he called, doctor jekyll or
something? My bet is 3 more weeks before you find him annoying and get bored
:P I really need to get out on some town or other, even that little sheep
village down the hill -- I've been cooped up in here so long that even Casemod
is starting to look like a delicious morsel of ladyhood. I mean, she'd be
delicious enough if she could grow up and learn to take herself seriously and
dress like an adult, and I do like them intelligent... but it's infuriating
how one of the best mechanical minds in the Valley and New York combined has
to come in such an insolent, gleefully illiterate, scantily clad little
package... Well, infuriating in the way that'd be hot to watch torrented, but
drives me up the wall to be shut in with in a converted old factory in
practically Russia. Anyways, see how badly I need this crap to be over and
odne so I can get out?

-Fish

P.S. If you happen to find any old tattoo flash in the drawers o' crap you
have to dig through, and it has peacocks or pinup girls, could you pass a
piece or two along? Case admitted the other day that she's secretly really
into that old stuff, and i figure as a backup plan I might as well get onto
her good side...

Fish, 

My goodness, dear brother, you do need to get out and get laid. There'll be
some flash in your next box... vids of hot and eligible chicks flashing the
camera, that is. And if there's a little silicone friend to help you out,
well, you're asking for it by showing the desparation of thinking like that
about a coworker of all things. Remember our rules? 

I had a rather entertaining encounter the other day, fallout from the
previously ignoble proprietors of our now hopefully a bit more noble business,
about whom I have no doubt told you at length already. As you've mocked me for
so often already, the previous owners of this lovely establishment are rather
famed throughout the city for their questionable business practices through
history. Well, today a gentleman came in who must have been a right
doppleganger of that crazy researcher Dr. Lou that you told me about, silly
mustache, grubby lab coat, and all! He demanded that I rifle through all of
our records for any hint as to the whereabouts  of a particular children's
book which allegedly came through either our shop or some other shop in the
state or some shop on the East Coast sometime between the 1920's and the '50s.
Thanks to your work on the OCR for inventory, there might have been a chance,
but he didn't even know its title or subject matter! I endeavored to placate
him with our lovely shelf of childrens' books out front, hoping that perhaps
the gratuitously racist and otherwise comically outmoded might sate his
curiosity, but to no avail. He was certain -- the only thing about which he
was certain -- was that the book he sought had left the country over half a
century ago. Customer service, eh? Be glad you're out there with only the
servers and the script kiddies to hassle you.

My gentleman lover Jacobi is most well, thank you for asking. He's only got a
few more weeks to go in rehab -- I'm so proud of the progress he's been
making! Our rather personal visitation time has been spectacular -- as he puts
it, sobriety is a hell of a drug. Perhaps you and I should try it some time...
but alas.

Thank you for your work on that lock -- the mechanical eludes me nigh as
effectively as proper grammar flees from you.

Ladies and gentlemen and those who aren't sure, fasten your seatbelts and hold
on tight because I am going to ROCK YOU! I had the absolute best idea EVER
today, while I was crawling around inside the poor cluster hooking back some
tubes that fell out when clumsy ole Drippy Drippy Drip was freaking out or
fucking around or fucking the thing or whatever it is that he does in there. I
wouldn't know; all I do is keep the good things going in and the bad things
going out so that the magic keeps happening inside those big shiney circuit
boards... 

I realized, I get to have the BEST JOB TITLE ~*.*EVAR*.*~... I work on air
conditioning, in a data center, so I AM AN AC/DC! I blasted highway to hell
super loud on the PA system to celebrate and I don't think Drips was very
happy about it, because he was being all shy and didn't come ask why I was so
awesome, but Fishbike kinda danced around and pretended to be all fancy like
he does. It reminded me of how lucky I am to have a great wonderful gorgeous
sumptuous delicious delightful lady like Kirah in my life, 'cause guys are
such derps even when they seem like they're doing everything right. And Kirah
doesn't even have to try <3~

Kirah sweetheart darling love of my life or at the very least of my body, I'm
making you a surprise! I know I'm terribly bad (terribad? terrier bad? cute
pictures in my head of fuzzy little doggies misbehaving <3) at keeping
secretes to i won't tell you that it's going to be shiney and i won't tell you
that it'll have gold on it and i reeeeally won't tell you how i'm making it
all by myself out of things that were left over from the computers so you'll
be shiningly stunningly beautiful and get to feel like you're part of the borg
like we talk about when we're playing all secretly together ;)

I hope that you're taking very good care of yourself and i miss you terribly
and especially your delicious wonderful amazing home cooking -- I've been
trying out your recipes but I just can't do them as well as you. I miss you
and I want you and I need you in my life, my dear, so you be a good girl ^_^

Chapter 16: the lab

"You got that email?" asked Drip, gesturing over his shoulder at Smith's email
on his incongruously unlocked screen during the morning's stand up meeting. 

"Ya, duh" retorted Case, "there shit you aren't telling us about?"

"Uhh. So. Yeah there's shit, but I haven't said a word of it to Smith. Dunno
how he knew." Drip was clearly uncomfortable with the whole situation.

"Ok, I don't care who told who, do we have an action plan?" Fishbike cut to
the core of the issue. "Well, *we* don't, because *we* as a group haven't
talked about it at all. I figured it was easy, but it sounds like not? If it's
all out of control, there might be things we all can do to get it back on
course."

"You'll think i'm psycho if i tell you what's been happening" Drip slumped
down the wall to rest his arms and head on his lanky knees, his voice's
inflection on the ragged edge of a sob.

"Naw man" Case's voice was suddenly compassionate. She crouched beside him and
pulled up the hem of her tank top, bunching its pattern of jagged lines
together to reveal a tattoo of a chesshire cat grin formed by the words "we're
all mad here", tracing the curve of her ribs above the left side of her waist.
"Drippy, lookit. I been crazy too. Drugs help, sometimes even the legal kind.
Spill what's up and we'll get you what you need?"

"Sure, can't get worse" conceded Drip reluctantly, then began to explain. "So
umm. I'll leave my explanations out of it for now. I tested the loggy stuff
when the data was only flowing one way, namely out of the cluster and onto the
log box, and everything went great. And so I hooked it up to process the logs
with the cluster's latent resources, like we talked about, and it all went to
shit. Well, not really. But there were subtle and pervasive errors in logs
which should've arrived back on the log box unchanged. I graphed them, and..."
his narrative stalled as a look of revulsion passed over his face, turned now
toward Smith's email and his still-unlocked console.

"Want to, uhh, head for the kitchen or some place?" Fish tried to extracate
him from the apparent source of his distress. 

"Nah." With his voice confident again, Drip seemed to have resolved to get the
unpleasant disclosure over with as efficiently as possible. He strode to the
console and chorded a command into his keyboard, his long slim fingers
stretching from mod to number keys like those of an organist playing for a
religious congregation.  The workspace switched from email to a browser window
containing the graph of a delta versus time, rhythmically spiking tall then
short then still, tall short still, tall short still. 

"I wish I didn't recognize this, but... " Drip gestured Case over and pointed
to her shirt and the screen in turn. "Human EEG, resting state, allowing mind
to drift" he explained the shirt, then "Error rate in the error logs on
yesterday's run" clarified the diagram on the screen. "Unmistakable."

"Shit, that's a wierd error" mused Fish, "But it's gotta just be some kind of
creepy synchronicity... "

"That's what I wanted to think, too" agreed Drip. "But..." His lithe digits
spelled a melodic chord progression which moved two terminals to share a third
workspace and concatenated an oddly named file to each.

"This," he jabbed angrily at the left, "was immediatley after we fixed it.
Second run, actually. Then I dialed everything way back to slow shit down and
get some useful debug metrics, and rather than my metrics I got around 30,000
copies of *that* instead of any useful logging!" The system administrator's
final gesture of emphasis was so violent that his nails snapped against the
screen and left the monitor rocking back and forth, slowly returning to
equilibrium with its squeaks the only interruption to the group's stunned
silence as they read and reread the messages.

The silence was broken by a clatter as the door swung shut after Expo, and the
shuffle of his slippers as he blearily crossed the data center's perforated
tile floor to see what could have drawn his coworkers into such a tight huddle
around Drip's screen. 

"Sorry I'm late" he muttered, carefully brandishing his oversized mug of
steaming coffee in the only remaining space where spills wouldn't jeopardize
any keyboards or shoes as he joined the crowd around the screen, "that the
computer?"

"mmhmm" Drip confirmed, snaking an arm over Expo's shoulder to switch
workspaces back to the log difference graph, "As is this."

"Well uhh" Expo blinked rapidly, stared alternatingly at the Cluster and the
screen, and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his free hand, "what'd you
change? better put it back, sounds like you're hurting the poor thing."

The rest of the team unanimously redirected their stares of befuddled
amazement from the Clutser to Expo. Glances shot between every permutation of
the three, each the same silent conversation: "He just called it a person?"
"Yeah, sounds like he cares about it" "I never heard him care about anything
at all before" "me neither". 

"Uhh." Drip was the first to interrupt this next shocked pause, perhaps by
dint of having had the most time to come to grips with the potential that
their valuable digital posession might be otherwise posessed. "I guess you're
right. The first message was after a run with real big data; the second had
all the debugging turned on and was running maybe 1/4 speed on a tiny fake
dataset... So I don't know where it thinks shit's going fast from..."

"oh, that's the easy part" Expo countered, "remember Weissman's application
special relativity to plausible computational motion?" Oblivious to the team's
blank stares, he continued, " If you get fewer ops per second than everything
around you, it'll look like it's going by very fast. If you're performing more
computations per second relative to the rate of input, the input will
subjectively appear to be coming in very slowly. It's why a backed up queue
can't keep up -- rate of process relative to rate of new data input. It's like
the first math class you take in post doctoral studies..." He trailed off,
finally remembering tht he was the only person in the room who had had the
patience to stick with academia for any further than an Associate's degree.
"Anyways, if you're computing slowly, the world seems to go fast. If you're
computing fast, the world seems slow. Ya?"

After several moments' thought, the others gradually began nodding their
affirmation. 

"Okay, so we overclock it?" postulated Casemod. "I could keep it within
operating temperatures to... half again the current speeds, give or take?" The
curvy hacker fidgeted with a spiral of metal embedded in the cartilege of an
ear which poked out of her vividly dyed hair as she ran the requisite
calculations in her head.

"Maybe" agreed Drippy, "but to spin it up like that, what do we tell it to
*do*? Shit's too smart to burn power on a bunch of no-ops, and I assure you
that nobody wrote a thing to yell on my terminal and scare the crap out of me.
So it's something emergent, but I don't know what we gotta push to get it to
emerge..."

"What've we been running lately?" mused Fish "Stupid ill-optimized boxes of
numbers from Liu's analytics again? I thought you fixed that with that
self-optimizing compiler you found out on the web" he grinned at Drip, fondly
recollecting the drinks over which he'd first heard the story of that
particular optimization.

"Ya, we're stuck with the compiler and we can effectively never go back, too
much speedup for the customers to ever let us revert" summarized the sysadmin.
"I mean, it was those matrices that we fed it before, but they won't run the
same way again -- estimate is that " his fingers flashed at the keyboard,
spelling out a quick harmony to the verbal discussion as he summoned a screen
of data and searched it for a key phrase, "45% of the numerical, calculation,
and general floating point rounding errors were eliminated by the third pass,
and by that time we had it going fast enough to run the whole set as the test
data whose results we saw *here*" he ruefully flashed the second message on
the screen before the staccato coda of a window switch back into the results
of the compiler's self-analysis. 

Expo crumpled his soft face into an expression of deep thought and gazed into
the monitor like a crystal ball for several seconds. "So it's not the quantity
of data, but the novelty, that seems to count?"

Drippy grinned. "Yep, from all two of our highly reliable and probably not a
prank by our crazy boss data points, I'd say your conclusion is exactly
right!" Sharing the situation with his coworkers, and the ensuing reasusrance
that he wasn't much crazier than the rest, seemed to have lifted a massive
weight off his shoulders. Pantomiming Expo's mannerisms of concern for the
machine, he skipped over to its plexi glass enclosure and spoke into it. "you
doing all right in there, little buddy? we'll get you some nice fresh data to
nom on and everything'll be okay."

Chapter 18: 

The past fortnight has been right eventful indeed, I dare say. I returned to
the city under the pretense of mongering a bargain between Father and a
viscount there, a most vain and pompous main who had decreed that his memoirs
ought be committed to print a thousandfold and strewn through book collections
throughout the land. I took with me my childhood friend Cuthbert, the barber's
son, for I had told him in jest over a flagon of ale the few stories which the
librarian had regailed me over and over on my previous journey. 

We hired lodings in the city's smaller inn, for Father has been prosperous of
late and said it should not do to have a member of his family found sleeping
in a barn again as I had done upon my previous trip. As we had gotten in quite
late, we fell almost immediately to sleep upon arriving. After breaking our
fast upon a delicious meal of fresh bread and the city's famous wursts, we
proceeded post haste to the lodgings of the librarian who had since my last
visit so consumed my curiosity and concerns. 

Imagine my shock, my astonishment, my surprise when our rap at the door,
patterned in a rhthm which the old man had insisted upon drilling into my mind
before I left to return home after my previous trip and which had formed the
cadence of my step for my whole walk back to Father's workshop, was greeted
not by the shuffling, decrepit old librarian but by a young lady, a nymph
describable only by the ancients' fabled songs, a true vision of loveliness.
Her wavy hair, the rich and luxuriant brown of a fattened rabbit in the fall,
drifted about her picturesque face in a halo, shiningly illuminated by the
sunbeams just beginning to peek through the window at the other end of the
entry hall, with some urgency as though they were eager to see the mirage of
perfection in front of me as well. This illusion of an angel visiting Earth by
instruction of our Lord's incalculable grace and wisdom was completed by her
raiment, a pure and simple snow-white gown, unembellished perhaps in the
recognition that any further adornment could not compete with her perfectly
flawless skin and would be wasted in marring the backdrop of her perfect
silhouette. 

The miracle on the other side of the door step pulled a faded blue robe over
her nightgown and brushed at her hair awkwardly, stammering an apology for her
dishabille which at least filled the awkward silence as I endeavoured to
recollect my once-respectable skill at marshalling sounds into words and words
into sentences. A lance of those devious, furtive sun beams, earlier unnoticed
in my distraction by my newfound muse, snuck through the hall window and made
a noble try at gouging out my left eyeball, which forced me to throw up a hand
in self-defense. The gesture reminded me of my manners, and the two good ideas
struck me at once to transform my motion into both a bow and a salute. This
led me to stumble, but catching myself on the doorstep, I threw forth a stream
of words apologizing for the intrusion and explaining that my sole goal had
been to visit my acquaintance the Librarian, in the hopes that the memory of
my eloquent explanation might overpowre that of my clumsily attempted
reverance faux pas.

Chapter 20: The 1920's

"Ulee", the old man called across the garden, "Come back now and I'll read you
a story before dinnertime". 

"But Grampa..." The 4-year-old took a last look at his construction, a pile of
twigs and bark that he described as "a big fort to keep out the injuns" when
his grandmother asked him about it on her slow, tottering walk around the
cabin's grounds that morning. The child's obedience won out, and he was
already trotting along the gravel path between the vegetable beds as his
great-grandfather called a further enticement: "I found another old-old book". 

The little boy's pace sped up with his excitement at that tantallizing piece
of information, and he tripped on the raised edge of a garden bed, sending
himself sprawling face-first only to catch himself with a collision between
his soft palms and the unforgiving rock pieces paving the path. Only a stone
on the path beneath him would have seen his face crumple with pain in
preparation to mark his reaction to this surprise with a childish wail, for by
the time he stood up and soberly dusted himself off, he had already regained
his composure. 

"Thank you for stories, grampa" he greeted his ancestor upon reaching the
porch, "but I'd best have Mama tie these up to keep from spoiling the book".
His great grandfather took the boy's tiny hands in his large and wizened ones
and turned them over, examining the drips of blood oozing from their scrapes.
"You're a brave little man indeed, Ulysses Zachary Smith. I'm proud of you."

The child skipped into the house, spirits lightened by his ancestor's
compliment, and returned a few minutes later with the lacerated palms bound
lovingly by his grandmother in clean strips of a worn out napkin from the bag
of rags kept in the pantry for just such occasions.

"Excuse me, may I have a story now, Grampa?" the small, respectful voice woke
the old man from a pleasant slumber into which he had drifted while his
descendent was indoors. 

"Indeed, young lad!" The old man seemed rejuvenated by the child's very
proximity to him. "This particular book is one that I think you haven't seen
before. I just today found it in a very old trunk in the attic" He produced a
large, thin book, its heavy vellum pages bound between leather-covered plates
of ancient wood. On the cover was embossed the silhouette of a craftsman at
his workbench,  the diagram flanked above and below by blackletter text so
ornate that the child, competent though he already was at following the
adventures of Dick and Jane in the work books that his elder sister sometimes
brought home to study from school, could not even tell what language it was
written in. 

"What book is it, grandpa?" The boy inquired excitedly, "Does this story book
have a book story like the book you read me about the trains?"

"That it does, dear boy" the great grandfather seemed pleased at the quick wit
being shown by his young relative. "A long, long time ago, long before your
mother or even her Mama was born, I traveled all around in a place called
Europe, way over on the other side of the globe. " He opened the book, drawing
his eyes in from the thousand yards he'd been staring back into a different
place and time. 

"There was a big building that had burned down, and part of my job was to help
the families who used to live there look through what was left and find the
things that they needed to keep. We worked for days on it, and at the end, we
had given the families who escaped their things back, and we had left over a
stack of things that didn't seem to belong to anybody there at all. One lady
said that this book used to belong to the little old man who lived next door
to her, and she remembered him reading it to his grandchildren when they came
to visit. She told me to take it back to America with me and read it to my own
grandchildren when I grew old..."

"How did she know you were an American, Grampa?" the child innocently filled
the silence. 

The old man sighed, knowing that there were some things of which he should
leave the youngster innocent for they would settle onto his shoulders as he
grew up and learned more of the ways of the world. Instead of answering, he
pointed to the elaboartely ornamented wall of impenetrable blackletter text on
the first page of the open book which he still held in his lap. 

"Es war einmal", he read, "That means Once Upon a Time." The child sat
quietly, entranced by the old book and the old man, as his forefather slowly
translated.

"There lived a blacksmith, whose name was Smith for that is what he was. He
was a most queer smith indeed, for he was the son of a wealthy man and yet had
chosen the more meager profession, for he spoke of its honesty. The smith had
apprenticed at first under a watchmaker, and only later learned the forging of
metal into larger parts and knives..."

"Dinner!" the story was interrupted by a sweet alto voice which pierced the
gathering dusk. 

"Best do as your Mama says, little one" the great grandfather shooed his great
grandson along the porch toward the cabin's door, "I'll be along, but I go
slower on these old bones."

He sat silently for a moment, reliving the sounds and smells of the corpses
and charred posessions that he and his squad had hauled out of a bombed-out
tenement so many years ago, before shutting his mind and the book with a snap
whose echo returned from the other side of the little mountain valley after a
respectful pause.

Chapter 21: England, 2 years ago

""FUCK YOU!" Mandy ended the argument by slamming the front door of the flat
so hard that the crystal adorned windchimes in the kitchen window tittered in
protest. A few furious strides down the front path forced her to stop,
retuning to the house to quickly grab a pair of boots from the entryway which
she seehingly pulled on over her already rain-drenched socks. Rather than
admitting her mistake by slamming the door a second time she left the door of
the flat wide open, muttering epithets of hope that its remaining occupant
would perish miserably of a terrible illness communicated by the cold air
which her gesture was allowing inside. 

She stomped along the path and arbitrarily turned right on the sidewalk,
pacing in a preoccupied manner along a route that would take her through the
center of the small, sleepy town. A small sleepy town for a small sleepy
career devoid of all interest or adventure, a bland unpalatable sickeningly
self contented place mirroring the boredom and apathy of being trapped in her
simple uninteresting unhurtful relationship with that stupid American. She'd
thought he was interesting, she'd thought he was glamorous, she'd thought that
because he used to work in a mental hospital and play guitar in a band that he
would have fascinating stories and be crazy in the exciting way and write
songs for her and make her different, make her special, make her the kind of
important person that everybody else told stories about. But no, all he wanted
to do was be sane and boring and -- that word with which she cursed the herds
of person like sheep and sheep like people eaqually in their backwater
farmer's town -- NORMAL. He wouldn't even objectify or mock or marginalize or
persecute her, and everybody knows that having a good villain in one's life
was almost better than being swept off your feet by the perfect Prince
Charming of a hero. Lends to audience interest, and all that, but did *she*
get to be interesting? No, of course not, despite her best efforts, despite
inscribing all the right combinations of her runes and incanting custom
designed spells that she'd commissioned for that exact purpose, she never got
a chance or a break.

The miserable, indecisive drizzly fog finally made up its mind that the cold
and damp felt better out of the clouds than in, and began to sheet down more
heavily, soaking through her decorative jacket and thin, uncomfortable dress.
Her firey consternation was quenched by this inopportune reminder of reality,
and fizzled out in a cloud of self pitying steam.  Everything was cold and wet
and gray and pathetic and miserable, and showed no signs of any improvement in
the foreseeable future. She stopped and just stood for an interminably dreary
minute, torn between the discomfort of continuing and the indignity of
returning to the flat and her now apparently ex boyfriend's inevitable
consideration and apology. 

"Are you all right, child?" a quavering voice called from the darkness across
the street. The voice's owner seemed to suddenly realize that she was
invisible to Mandy, and flicked on a warm incandescent bulb. Its candleish
light spilled out from the plate glass window and open door to reveal that
Mandy's rage had run out of (or more accurately, gone up in) steam across the
street from the cozy, comfortable town's little book and antique store, run by
little old Constance Spebbington, who'd been a bent and graying epitome of
grandmotherly hospitality since before anyone else in the town could remember.
"Come indoors, you'll catch your death of cold out there, dear girl."

Carefully omitting any thoughts of how she'd been making similar wishes toward
her on again off again partner mere minutes earlier, for fear that the old
crone might be able to read minds, Mandy hid her annoyance at being recued
with a facade of polite appreciation.

Chapter 22: the data center building's kitchen

"So" concluded Drip, finishing his last mouthful of the casserole that Case
mod had pulled together the previous evening out of the canned and dry
nonperishable ingredients with which their base of operations was exclusively
stocked, "We just need Fishbike's bro in the valley to dig us up a copy of
some old Care and Feeding of Sentient Mainframes guide that got left in an
attic over the dot com bust, or Expo to suddenly remember reading that kind of
stuff on a torrent tracker and magically recite the hash like he sometimes
does, and then talk Gorram Smith in to putting the thing on payroll?" His mood
seemed vastly improved by the team's support and reasurance that he wasn't
about to be returned to the psychiatric hospital, especially on the wrong side
of the padded straps. 

Case and Fish nodded and Expo's face and shoulder twitched in the mannerism
which the team had learned to read as casual agreement. "So do we introduce
it, or let it come out and say hi to him itself?" Case mod wondered to
herself.

"We do" proclaimed Fish, simultaneously with Expo's equally assertive
exclamation "It does." Both begain talking rapidly and enthusiastically at
once in a parallel monologue that only a movie crew with perfectly positioned
directional microphones and many hours on its hands could have untangled.
Throughout the exchange Case and Drip looked at each other in an exasaparated
inquiry of "all right, who has to play the adult this time?" and the tall,
scrawny man eventually lost.

The sysadmin whose logging project appeared to have originally preciipateed
the debate at hand shifted his demeanor slightly, mentally putting on his
infrequently used bureaucracy and management hat to settle the dispute. "All
right, Fishy first, what should we do and why?" he inquired, then pre empted
the pudgy opponent's protests with "Expo, you *wait*. You're next."

"We have no idea what that thing would say" Fish began. "We don't know what
its motives are, or if it even has motives at all in the way that we typically
think of them occurring in humans. Model the flow of information: Smith
demands certain highly specific concesssions in the most recent set of changes
to the pet project he's been working with for who knows how long, then the
thing started talking to Drip here, and then with no further prompting, Gorram
Smith anticipates that something has gone wrong and pings the team
accordingly. Best case it's just that he took a lucky guess and followed his
bad feelings about Drip's architecture plans to their logical conclusion...
But worst case, this was the goal of the project all along and he's in league
with Liu to carefully calculate the optimal test data to run through to get
the thing to say particular stuff. Sure, I don't know how that would *help*
them, but if we're up against a cartoon super villain... You know what super
villains usually do to their teams of science folks once the super weapon is
completed. I say we keep everything on the record, preferably somebody else's
and the Google servers are great for this if we keep correspondence through
external email, because our purpose is twofold: First, we cover our own asses
and try to get out of here alive, and secondly, we are trying to make life
easier for the forensic investigators on the Good Guys' side if we're dead,
Smith's halfway through taking over the world, and shit is generally fucked
up."

"Umm. Wow." Drippy had forgotten that he might have wanted to compose a
synopsis or reply, and simply sat enthralled by the hitherto unforeseen
possibilities illuminated by Fish's rhetoric. "Uhh, Expo?"

"It's a person." The short, pale endomorph seemed more animated and engaged
than any of his comrades could ever recall seeing him. "If I'm a person, so is
it. It's not its fault where it came into existance and it has no control of
who's delegated to take care of it yet. We're like it's parents.There are a
lot of ways for parents to fuck up -- " All three of the other hackers in the
room grimaced and nodded wryly, recalling their own and their peers'
ancestors' various categories of terrible mistakes, then Expo continued "--
and we've all seen a lot of them and I promised myself that if I ever somehow
accidentally ended up with a kid it would not be like that. Now we've got a
little creature, an apparently sentient living entity which is more than you
can even say for an infant human at least on the sentience front, totally
dependent on us so we have to be absolutely careful... "

The mainframe-connected tablet that Drip had been placed above the stove
flashed black and white rapidly to draw the team's attention, then scrolled
the blinking marquee text "THANK YOU". 

Everyone was shocked, but Expo realized he still had the floor. "It, uhh,
learns fast?" He seemed to be partially reconsidering the confidence with
which he'd argued his previous stance. 

"Err. Yeah." Drip appeared to be reconsidering his recent decisions as well.
"You said it might eat entropy, so before we came up here I piped the security
system's feeds in as input and threw on a few of the shittier and more broken
sound and video processing algorithms to keep the corres spinning..."

"That's great, but can I have my tablet back now?" Case coped with the stress
by reverting to an even more petulant and juvenile mode of behavior than her
typical childish outlook. "OOPS IM SOR" blinked the marquee, and the device
powered off. 

"Well... All right... I need a drink..." Fish stood and sauntered toward the
industrial sized refrigerator, hands jammed deep in his pockets to hide the
frequency at which they were shaking.

﻿Chapter 23: Jen Snuth

I am reduced to toiling in terror each day that the King's men will find the
Machine, whose constituent parts now lie wrapped in tallowed linen and buried
in an ignominous grave beneath my workshop's floor. I am trapped indeed now,
though, for the buyers of my blades have grown accustomed to the larger
quantity and low price of blades, whose mystery has drawn such ill attention
down upon me. Woe that all my proceeds and revenues from such enterprising
work were poured back into the machine itself, and dispersed as needed by
those mysteroius Peers whose secrets conveyed unto me laid the cornerstone of
that accursed device's creation. Would that I had heeded the fairy stories,
the tailes of wish granting fishes and leprechauns that magically bring gold,
to learn that any group so fantastical as the Peerage must be only that, a
fantasy. 

This is the lowest point of my whole existance, worse even than Father's
maltreatment and exile, worse even than that terrible fire which destroyed my
good master Clock Maker's house before I came to work in the smithy here.  

To complicate it all, this morn, my dear and patient wife stepped outdoors to
fetch an augmentation of our meager breakfast from the garden's first blush of
spring,  and nearly tripped upon a bundle on our doorstep! A child, left as an
infant would be, was swaddled in a dirty rag and sat upon our stoop. But this
was no infant -- nay, by the size of it the babe must be upwards of seven or
eight years old, although it's a skinny and malnourished child indeed. The
creature made nary a sound and just sat, still and pathetic, in a half barrel
of chilly water as we bathed it before the fireplace and cut the matted
patches from its hair. It was once a little boy, but looks messily scarred
where it was gelded as a ram or a choirboy. But for sooth, I can not tell ye
any thing of the timbre of its voice, because not even when pinched or
splashed with water does it make any sound. We fed it a bowl from our supper
of gruel and the voracity with which it gorged itself on the paste made it
clear that a tongue is still in its rightful place in the mouth, and none of
the teeth seem rotted or knocked out. For all of that, it does not chatter as
a child of that age should, nor even seem to try to make a single word. Though
it does not come to us yet with any word or need, it does shy away when I or
Good Wife Snuth move quickly, as would a dog grown much accustomed to being
kicked about at its drunkard owner's whim. 

Yet the rules of foundling babes see no exception of age for a creature too
week of mind to tell its own, so it seems the Lord and Country leave us no
recourse but to keep it and raise it up in some way like our own. I cannot
help but wonder whether I am being punished for the slight against the divine
order of Creation with which I offended a greater Power in crafting that pox
upon my house the Machine, and being reprimanded by the penance of teaching a
pathetic child as I had until so recently taught the great Device with so
light a heart and so hopeful a mind. For indeed, it seems that I've no choice
but to take the wretch into my workshop as Apprentice as well as into my home,
to help recoup some of the costs that feeding and clothing such a quickly
growing youth will inevitably impart onto our already tenuous state of
capital.

﻿Chapter 24: Erasmus & Cuthbert

Dearest Diary, I feel that I should apologize to thee for thy recent neglect,
and yet 'tis only the sudden onset of an urge to practice chivalry in all
things which should lead me to write such words at all. For rather than being
cloistered in Father's workshop, among all the hazards of life as a Monk but
none of the eventual divine rewards, I have been cloistered in the old
Librarian's home with all the joys of the world: The thrilling chase of
deliciously forbidden knowledge through the Librarian's papers in our attempt
to ascertain his whereabouts, the delicious tastes and smells which waft in
through the window or are carried in through the door of the apartment as with
any room overlooking a bustling city's market square, and then tantallizing,
enthralling, capitvating face and angelic form and melodic voice of our lovely
Winifred. But I suppose I have jumped ahead of my tale, just as I feel that I
have jumped so far ahead in my friendships and adventures of late. 

Cuthbert and I discovered that the muse upon the threshhold is actually miss
Winnifred Chelsey, granddaughter of Mr. Oswin Chelsey, who had come to live
with him as his sole heir when her parents, the Librarian's daughter and his
son in the law, perished in a terrible shipwreck in going aobut their trade as
merchants and traders when she was but a lass. She had grown up with her
grandfather, learning the arts of ladyhood from the lovely old dowagers who
shared the little apartments above, below, and next door. As I had secretly
vowed upon first seeing Miss Winnifred to go to any length to bring her any
whim which her radiant heart might desire, thou cannst imagine my delight when
her curiosities about her grandfather aligned with my own personal mission in
visiting the city at all,  and we spent several days digging through his boxes
upon boxes of correspondences. 

I learned most fascinating facts ideed about some Peerage or Group of Greatest
Illumination and Utmost Secrecy But Impeccable Repute with which it seemed the
elderly gentleman had been involved in his youth, and read an odd little story
in it which inspired a story for a fairy tale book that I plan to add to
Father's collection of plates upon my return home. I hope that I shall be able
to console miss Winnifred with a copy of the book printed from those plates
which, as I shall hide in the engravings, shall be dedicated solely to her. I
fear that she may require consolation, though, for through all our hunt we
found no clues to the present or future disposition or location of her beloved
ancestor. Perhaps we might have made superior progress had Cuthbert dedicated
more of his own efforts to our common task of the papers and fewer to his
foolish capers of intent to impress my dearest and most deeply desired miss
Winnifred, but he has never been much for letters and I fear his clumsy force
might have torn the delicate pages over which I and the incongruouously
incarnated angel pored.
