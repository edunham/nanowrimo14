Chapter 7: Expo's Nightly Email To Himself

Be surprised that logging isn't working right for Drippy. He will be very
upset over it so to empathize, be sad that his plan did not work. Be pleased
or excited that the care packages arrived, because I was looking forward to
the books and candy. Continue being annoyed at the remoteness of our location
from civilization and proper roads. Remember to ask after Case's lady Kirah
who was sick last week because it is polite to remember peoples' families.
Remember the heuristic that asking more than two questions in a row about a
significant other indicates interest and is construed as creepy.

Current nick is expon. Current nickserv password is campbells. Monitoring
account setup used business email  and the password memorized at the beginning
of January. 

For standup meeting tomorrow, emotion to construe is neutral. Give update on
having continued work on QA and show mild frustration at contractors' slow
replies.
