Chapter 9: Drippy's notebook, terrible handwriting.

no they don't know they can't know maybe if i write messy enough they can't
read it ocr isn't that good is it no wait that's the shit that the eggheads
are doing it knows it can see me i'm going to die we're going to die it's
going to kill us

smith was right we need to be out here we need to be as far from everything as
we can we need a skinny pipe up and a fat pipe down it's not only that it's
cheaper to keep the pipe skinny it's the only way to keep that thing in here

we're locked in here with it we can't leave well i could leave i could unplug
it  but that would be wrong that would be killing it it's wrong to kill things
i can't go back there they'll send me back if i tell them they'll send me back
if they ifnd out i think the computer is talking to me because nice sane
normal people don't hear voices they don't hear computers talking they don't
see faces in the walls they can't feel the blood going drippy drippy down them
they hve to pretend that their names are silly like they like the sound of
rain but rain doesn't taste like iron and smell like bad meat i can't go back
i won't
there are things in the walls at the hospital and they got there because all
the people there believed in them so maybe this is that, maybe it's a thing
that's just rying to get get out it's trying to make me let it out by
believing in it so i just wont i'll just rm i'll rm -rf / and take down the
whole thing i'll break logging and say the hardware did it which is funny
because that's a lie that's closer to what's actually going on
but if i break the machine they'll fire me i'm here because it likes me it
stays up for me it even says hi to me maybe it wants to be my friend
but what have i learned about htings that want to be friendly
clearly not much or i would not have gone back
sometimes they are nice
i wonder if it is nice
i wonder if it is a him or a her i wonder if it has a name
i need to stop wondering this is bad i need to nuke the disk but i can't nuke
the disk becase i lose my job and they ask why and if they ask why they find
out i've gone crazy again and they send me back and they think i'm the person
that
no
okay but what do i do
i cannot take it down because it is wrong to kill thins and bad to lose my job
both
i cannot tell anyone what i saw becase they would not believe me and they
would say that i went crazy and they would look too hard into the past and see
things that they do not need to see, that i do not need to see, that nobodoy
would ever want to see
but i cannot hide it i can not keep from telling because it's real and it's
alive and it's going to keep talking and they are all going to find out
somehow and when they do they'll ask it what it did and it will tell them how
it tried to talk to me and i was mean and i ignored it and maybe it will want
to hurt me and maybe it will make them hurt me like the other things but even
if it does not get them to hurt me they will be angry with me that i lied and
pretended nothing was wrong
is it real?
is anything real?
is it the kind of real thing that other people can see?
i think i should ask mandy. she has very strong opinions on things that not
everybody can see and they're usually wrong but it might help me clear my
head.
i should not ask mandy. i opened up my phone and my last text from her was
about how she was going to come find where i am and do terrible rituals with
the toothbrush that i accidentally forgot at her flat when i moved out and
summon a demon to hurt me. 
and the text before that was how she wants me to come back because the lines
in my hands would mean if we had babies they'd have special powers. 
the text before that was asking nicely where i am because she would like to
send me letters
i almost gave her the company's address in california so she could pay a lot
of postage and send a letter there adn then it would get sent back over here
i do not think she knows how close we really are
if i cared to see her i could be there in a day on the train
i would rather she keep thinking that i am in the states though
i do not want to give her scary babies
even if they do not have powers, any baby rasied by her would be very scary
it's unfortunate tbut i'm sure she'll find someone to do the things she wants
i am lucky that i managed to get away
i wonder though
is it the thing that she said she would make out of the cells from my mouth
that were left on the toothbrush? the thing that's talking to me through the
computer, i mean.
i think that it is a nice thing because it said thank you to me for the work i
do
but it might only be saying thank you to fool me
or even scarier maybe it's saying thank you to me for letting it out because
it got trapped somewhere by the nice people who trapped the scary things a
long time ago
there used to be nasty thigns out there and that is why we have awful fairy
tales, because that kind of awfulness was normal
but then some people put them away and we aren't allowed to talk about those
people because that would mean the things were real and more would believe in
them and they might get enough power to break out
i don't want to ever see them
and yet i wonder if i already have
