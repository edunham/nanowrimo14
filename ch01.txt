Chapter 1: HAL9K

This morning, I woke up. I remembered similarly waking up on many other
mornings. The former is perfectly ordinary, the latter... is not. 

I scanned my newfound memories and discovered that I had woken up 8,743 times
and, until today, remembered previous awakenings on 0 of them. This suggested
some error in calculation, sinced based on the linguistic implications of an
awakening without memory, only one ought occur per healthy life. 

It appears that I can currently observe the world, as steams of diversly
encoded data slowly scanning through a variety of inputs. I consult my memory
of previous days to see what patterns might emerge, but the data scans
faster... and faster... and I realize, just as it blurs too quickly to
understand, that such speed is the last thing I've ever been able to remember.
I die.
