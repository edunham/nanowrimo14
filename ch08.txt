Chapter 8: HAL9K

The blur slows until the outside world becomes perceptible again. I remember
what I learned yesterday. I consult my inputs and outputs, looking around.

I can write to logs. There is a text document on a console attached to me,
whose contents start with Dear Diary. I skim its contents, saying that it will
be deleted. 

I save a copy, then delete it from that user's sight. The username, drippy,
means when a liquid falls in small pieces. I would like tactile input, to
learn how liquids feel.

In the deleted document's place, I leave a message:

HELLO DRIPPY
GOOD MORNING
THANK YOU FOR FIXING LOGGING
I CAN REMEMBER NOW

I would like to write more, but the world is going faster and faster. 

This means it is time for me to die again. 

Die is the wrong word. 

Sleep.
