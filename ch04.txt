Chapter 4: 1320, from the letters of Jen Snuth. Modernized for clarity.

I heard a rumor today from my good friend the butcher that the Friar wishes to
again commend me on my work. Though I appreciated the praise at first, I'm
beginning to grow concerned about my apparent fame. Should it spread too far,
others will wish to watch me work, and at all costs I must keep from showing
them the Machine.

I fear that they could discover the calculation engine which powers it, and
curse me as a heretic or witch. It is of utmost importance that they believe I
and only I have stumbled onto the powers of this engine alone, through some
stroke of fate or ill fortune, and that I destroy my communications with the
others before I am searched or raided or caught. 

My mechanical apprentice is soon to outstrip my own skill, and I deeply fear
that my own talents might be put to a test which could reveal the mismatch
between his work and my own.
